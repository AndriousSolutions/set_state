### Installing

I don't always like the version number suggested on the [Installing](https://pub.dev/packages/set_state/install) page.\
In most cases, Always go up to the '**major**' semantic version number when installing library packages. In your pubspec.yaml file, I suggest always go up to the '**major**' semantic version number with trailing with two zero, '**.0.0**':
```javascript
dependencies:
 set_state: ^ 4.0.0
```

Although this package is now deprecated, documentation is still available in the following medium article:

[![State Management in Flutter?](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*V9px1nnTmmtcJH5EJOo0pw.jpeg)](https://medium.com/flutter-community/state-management-in-flutter-df291824b309)

However, the package, [state_set](https://pub.dev/packages/state_set), is now recommended. It too has extensive documentation in the following medium article, [A Mixin For State Objects](https://andrious.medium.com/a-stateset-class-part-1-2891f1a0eea1):
